<p> As you can see, it is currently under construction. A few essentials, including CV and education 
  diplomas, can be found under the Documents tab. Please be in touch for any questions or documents!</p>

<p>I graduated fom the University of Surrey, obtaining a Masters in Physics with Nuclear Astrophysics.
  For my masters project, I studied the accretion history of the Milky Way at the Potsdam Leibniz Institute 
  for Astrophysics. In light of the groundbreaking observations from the JWST and the upcoming generation of 
  ground-based telescopes, I am interested in galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe and seek
  to pursue a Ph.D. investigating high redshift galaxies through observation and modelling.
